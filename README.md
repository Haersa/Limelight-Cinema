# Limelight-Cinema

## Project Overview
HND Full-Stack Project, my first time working with a database and pulling content from it to be rendered in HTML. This cinema booking system allows different types of users to interact with the platform.
This Full-Stack project's main focus was on the integration with the back-end and primarily focused on the PHP/SQL elements rather than the content on the pages. That is why what you see here is an "incomplete" website in regards to some pages being left empty, as the submission checklist was mostly focused on the PHP/SQL functionality. Most of the submission outcomes focused on the admin CRUD functionality, which I achieved early on in my development, which allowed me to incorporate additional features, such as a dynamic contact form submission area, a separate upload form for promotional content, and a more comprehensive User credentials CRUD table.

It is still a work in progress, and I will hopefully keep working on it as time progresses to finish it and give it a fully-fledged look. However, I think it is a good example of the work I can produce right now, and in time, my JavaScript and CSS skills will be built up to match the standards of this submission.

## Test Credentials
- **Adult User:** Username = tester5, Password = tester5
- **Junior User:** Username = junior1, Password = junior1
- **Admin:** Username = admin1, Password = admin1, Passkey = adminpasskey

*To find the admin login form, look in the bottom right corner of the footer on the desktop; the link to it is found next to the privacy policy page link. On mobile screens, it will be more towards the middle of the footer.*

## Key Technologies
- PHP & MySQL database
- Flickity carousel for the carousels/sliders
- CSS grid & Flex layout
- CSS Variables
- Custom feedback system similar to toast notifications

## Testing Instructions
To test the ticket booking functionality:
1. Log into the admin account
2. Click the "Generate Showtimes" button on the 'Movie Management' page within the admin panel on any movie
3. This will generate showtimes in all 4 cinemas for the week
4. Log out and sign in to the adult account to carry out the booking process

## Development Notes
Most of the JavaScript has been found either in StackOverflow, off the shelf from W3Schools, or in Web Development threads/communities in which I have asked for help; however, this was allowed within the project as the main focus was on the PHP & SQL functionality.

Since I have moved away from using Bootstrap to build the UI of my sites, with this being the first one, a lot of the CSS used to style the website (layout-wise) has been learned/followed along from tutorials/threads. All other CSS is my own, however.

This is the first step in my Web development journey towards doing everything myself, without relying on frameworks/libraries like Bootstrap. While I am proud of this work, as it is my first Full-Stack website, it isn't perfect as I am still learning and not a professional.
