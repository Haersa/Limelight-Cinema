# Limelight-Cinema
HND Full-Stack Project, my first time working with a database and pulling content from it to be rendered in HTML. 

Adult User Credentials - Username = tester5, Password = tester5
Junior User Credentials - Username = junior1, Password = junior1
Admin Credentials - Username = admin1, Password = admin1, Passkey = adminpasskey

*To find the admin login form, look in the bottom right corner of the footer, the link to it is found next to the privacy policy page link*

This project has used Flickity carousel for the carousels/sliders, a mix of CSS grid & Flex, CSS Variables and an off-the-shelf JavaScript quiz/game, as allowed within the project.
I built the custom feedback messages after researching something similar to solid-toast. It uses a PHP session that is set upon successful task completion and is unset afterwards to allow it to echo out the toast div.

*To test the ticket booking functionality, log into the admin account and click generate showtimes button on the 'Movie Management' page within the admin panel on any movie(will work for all); this will generate showtimes in all 4 cinemas for the week; you can then log out and sign in to the adult account to carry out the booking process.*

Most of the JavaScript has been found either in StackOverflow, off the shelf from W3Schools, or in Web Development threads/communities in which I have asked for help; however, this was allowed within the project as the main focus was on the php & SQL functionality.
